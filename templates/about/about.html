      <h2>About <strong>Faamaya EcoTech</strong></h2>
      <p>
        The Eco-social Restoration Platform aims to contribute to the transformation of the Great Green Wall initiative by combining AI-driven species selection with deep community engagement.
        While current tree planting sees 70–80% failure rates across the Sahel, our integrated approach leverages environmental DNA analysis, satellite imaging, machine learning, and community-owned monitoring to create self-sustaining ecosystems.
        Our five-year implementation plan transitions from data collection to local ownership, generating revenue through carbon credits while empowering communities via mobile payment systems and AR tools.

      <h2>The Challenge We Are Solving</h2>
      <p>
        The Great Green Wall initiative has invested billions, yet faces staggering 70–80% tree planting failure rates across the Sahel region.
        Only 4% of the original reforestation goals have been achieved. This isn’t just an environmental crisis—it is a failure of approach that impacts millions of lives.
